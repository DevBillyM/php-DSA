# PHP DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) – Beginner's Guide

## Project Overview

Welcome to the **PHP DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** repository! This project is designed to help beginners learn and understand various data structures and algorithms using **modern PHP code** in 2024. Each script focuses on a specific data structure or algorithm, providing step-by-step explanations and code samples.

## Who is this For?

This repository is intended for:

- PHP developers who are new to data structures and algorithms.
- Beginners looking to learn and practice DSA in PHP using clean, modern code.
- Developers who want to improve their problem-solving skills by learning efficient algorithms and data structures.

## Prerequisites

To follow along, you should have:

- Basic understanding of PHP syntax (variables, functions, loops).
- A PHP development environment (PHP 8.x recommended).
- Knowledge of basic programming concepts (such as loops, conditionals, and functions).

## How to Use This Repository

- Each topic is broken down into individual scripts focused on a specific algorithm or data structure.
- Start with basic data structures like arrays and progress to more advanced topics like dynamic programming and graph algorithms.
- Open any PHP file in your favourite IDE or editor, read through the code, and run it in your terminal or browser.
- Use this as a learning tool and reference for writing clean, efficient PHP code.

## Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables
- Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees)
- Heaps
- Graphs (DFS, BFS, Shortest Path Algorithms)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms (Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms
- Backtracking Algorithms
- Recursion
- Time Complexity and Big-O Notation

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevBillyM/php-DSA
   cd php-DSA
   ```

2. **Run any PHP file:**
   Make sure you have PHP installed, and then run any script in the repository by typing:

   ```bash
   php path/to/script.php
   ```

3. **Follow the code comments:**
   Every script contains comments explaining the steps and logic behind the code. Follow along with the comments to understand the flow of each algorithm.
